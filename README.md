Why does this need to exist?
============================
This project fills the void for Windows users who want to quickly get started with Funge-98 (not just Befunge-93,) without complex compilation, and, most of all, want to see the IP dance around FungeSpace. In addition, the Funge specific editor makes writing Funge code much more enjoyable than using Notepad. No other Funge tool combines these features.

Where is the project at right now?
